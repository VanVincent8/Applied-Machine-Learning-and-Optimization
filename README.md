# Applied-Machine-Learning-and-Optimization

This code has been made during the course Applied Machine Learning and Optimization. The subject is divided in three categories:
- ___Simulation___ where you can see a simple simulation of a warehouse: stock, orders, amount to order.
- ___Optimization___ where we solve a linear programming problem with the package ´Pulp´ of python.
- ___Machine Learning___ where you can find stacking model whose base is composed of a random forest and linear model and the meta learner is a Ridge regression in order to predict the engine-off time.
